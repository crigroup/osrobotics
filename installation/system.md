# System: ROS, Gazebo

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing and executing robot programs. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to
simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide
variety of robotic platforms.

## ROS installation

Set-up your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org and set-up your
keys following the steps described at http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu

Now, install the ROS bare bones
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
# Installation
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-wstool ros-kinetic-ros-base
# Initialize rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Create a ROS workspace

Letâ€™s create a [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces)
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Even though the workspace is empty (there are no packages in the $$\texttt{src}$$ folder,
just a single $$\texttt{CMakeLists.txt}$$ symbolic link) you can still build the workspace
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```

Before continuing, source your workspace $$\texttt{setup.bash}$$ file
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, make
sure `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` environment variable includes the path to your
workspace
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
```

This is the expected output
```
/home/USERNAME/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share:/opt/ros/kinetic/stacks
```

### Configure your .bashrc

Every time you start a new terminal, the file `~/.bashrc` will be sourced. When
you already have an opened terminal, you can source it manually running this
command
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

In order to use ROS, you need to source the ROS `setup.bash` file, therefore,
it's recommended to include the previous command in your `.bashrc` file.
You can do so by running this
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Testing the installation

Let's try to run $$\texttt{roscore}$$ in a first terminal. Then, publish a $$\texttt{std_msgs/String}$$
message to the topic $$\texttt{/some_topic_name}$$ a second terminal. Finally, subscribe
to the same topic and print it out the message in a third terminal:
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
# Terminal 1
roscore
# Terminal 2
rostopic pub -r 1 /some_topic_name std_msgs/String 'Hello World!'
# Terminal 3
rostopic echo /some_topic_name
```

### ROS packages installation
For the sections where interaction with hardware components is required,
we will simulate these components using Gazebo. More details can be found in
the [ROS architecture section](../system/architecture.md).

### ROS packages from source

Go to the source folder of your ROS workspace
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

Make sure that you have [cloned the course repository](../installation/basic_tools.md#git).

Now, use the $$\texttt{wstool}$$ to install required packages from source repositories
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
wstool init .
wstool merge osr_course_pkgs/dependencies.rosinstall
wstool update
```

Install any missing dependencies using `rosdep`
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
```

If `rosdep` is unable to install python-termcolor, install it manually
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-termcolor
```

Now compile your ROS workspace:
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make install
```

### Dependencies

`rosdep` is very useful to install system dependencies but those dependencies
have to be included by the ROS community, therefore few packages need to be
install manually:
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
# Packages from Ubuntu repositories
sudo apt-get install blender openscad python-rtree
# Python modules
pip install control trimesh --user
```

### Testing the installation

Let's try visualizing the robot using [RVIZ](wiki.ros.org/rviz)
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
roslaunch osr_description visualize_robot_gripper.launch
```

![Robot visualization in RVIZ.](../assets/installation/denso_in_rviz.png)

Play with the sliders to see how you can move the robot. This is a simple
visualization where nothing is actually simulated. A simple test could be to
move the robot to a configuration where it is in self-collision.

Finally, check that you can run the gazebo simulation:
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
roslaunch osr_gazebo robotic_setup.launch
```
> #### Note::Gazebo takes for ever loading
The first time you run gazebo, it will download several models
available online. You may want to start first gazebo alone and give it time to
download the models:
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
gzserver --verbose
```

![Robot simulation in Gazebo.](../assets/installation/denso_in_gazebo.jpg)

> #### Note::Gazebo failure
In case of failure starting the simulation, check the
[system requirements for Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_b1&cat=#Systemrequirements).
If your computer does not have a dedicated video card, it is likely that you
will not be able to run the graphical interface. Try setting the $$\texttt{gui}$$
parameter to false
{% label %}command-line{% endlabel %}
```bash
roslaunch osr_gazebo robotic_setup.launch gui:=false
```
